<h1 align="center">OctoPrint-Legacy</h1>

You are looking at the OctoPrint-Legacy repository. This repository is strictly
for legacy support of OctoPrint versions before 1.8.0 and will only see updates
in an absolute emergency.

All current development happens at [OctoPrint/OctoPrint](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint)
and that is also where you should direct issues and PRs.

This repository should be considered unmaintained and only in place long-term for
historical purposes.
